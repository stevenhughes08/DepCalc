# DepCalc
This is my current version of the Depletion Calculator. 

DepCalc is a project for Code Louisville C#/.Net

1) Once downloaded you will need Visual Studio 2017 to run it. 

2) This project utilizes the Bootstrap CDN so internet access is required for the page to display properly.  

3) This Program is currently in development; the search field is not active at this time, however CRUD functions work. 

  A) To access CRUD functions, Click on "Items" in the Nav-Bar at the top of the page. This will talke you to a page where you can CREATE, READ, EDIT and Delete inventory items. Att this time once an Item is added it does not show up on the page but it does add the item to the database. The DataBase is DepCalcContext. 
  
  Thank you
