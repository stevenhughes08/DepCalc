# DepCalc
This is my current version of the Depletion Calculator. 

DepCalc is a project for Code Louisville C#/.Net 
This project utilizes the Bootstrap CDN so internet access is recommend for the page to display properly.  
This Program is currently in development; the search field is not active at this time, however CRUD functions work. 
You will need to go under Items link below the Depletion Calculator hyperlink CRUD functions will be available there.
